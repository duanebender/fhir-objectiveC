/**
 * A schedule that specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Schedules are not used for recording when things did happen, but when they are expected or requested to occur. A schedule can be either a list of events - periods on which the event occurs, or a single event with repeating criteria, or just repeating criteria with no actual event.
